## About <a name = "about"></a>

<p align="justified">
It is a simple, text prompt based slot machine game. It mimics a comparatively simple slot machine with a 3x3 display. The user interacts with the game via terminal. At first the user needs to deposit some balance. The player can place bet on single or multiple lines. During the game the player can also exit the game. For beginning a new game the player needs to run the script again.
